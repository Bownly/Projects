# In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

#     1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).

# It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

#     1x£1 + 1x50p + 2x20p + 1x5p + 1x2p + 3x1p

# How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

some kinda recursion

$1 = 100 pennies

coinarray = [200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]

def countcombos(twopounds, coins):

	if you can add the largest coin, 
		add largest coin if possible, but also add 
	else:
		return 0





	return 1 + countcombos(twopounds, coins)
